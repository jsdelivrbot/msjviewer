    <h1>Mobile MSJ</h1>

    <h2>The <em>Unofficial</em> Android MSJ app</h2>

    <p>
        This is an <em>unofficial</em> Android app to help you use MSJ from your Android phone.
        It is not affiliated with St John in any way, other than being created by a St John member.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a hobby project, and I take no responsibility if it doesn't work, kills a kitten, or catches fire.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        This app works like your web browser - it literally visits the official MSJ website and
        displays the contents to you in the app. However, before displaying them, the app changes
        the "styles" to make it fit better on a smaller mobile phone screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why the screen may flicker a little bit after displaying a page. It is first
        loading the original, and then it is restyling it to display nicely on a mobile device.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>

    <p>
        It was built because I was frustrated at the non-mobile-friendly MSJ website.
        Most times that the website is useful is at divisional meetings and at events, when
        you are around other volunteers and deciding together what events to attend.
        I released the app it in the hope that others will also find it useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Find a bug? / Want to request a feature?</h2>

    <p>
        If you found a bug in this app, or there is a feature that you think is missing,
        contact me at peter.serwylo@gmail.com. Send through as much detail as possible,
        and I'll endeavour to get back to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        This app respects your privacy. It doesn't send any information to anywhere other
        than the official MSJ website (<a href="https://ssl.stjohnvic.com.au">https://ssl.stjohnvic.com.au</a>).
        If you are technically minded, and would like to verify this, the code is free and open source and
        available on <a href="http://github.com/pserwylo/msjviewer">GitHub</a>.
