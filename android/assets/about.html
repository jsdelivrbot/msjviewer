    <h1>Mobile MSJ</h1>

    <h2>The <em>Unofficial</em> Android MSJ app</h2>

    <p>
        This is an <em>unofficial</em> Android app to help you use MSJ from your Android phone.
        It is not affiliated with St John in any way, other than being created by a St John member.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a hobby project, and I take no responsibility if it doesn't work, kills a kitten, or catches fire.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        When you browse MSJ using this app, your phone is quite literally visiting the official MSJ website and
        retrieving the contents, then displaying them in this app.
        However, before displaying them, the app changes the "styles" to make it fit better on a smaller mobile
        phone screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>

    <p>
        It was built because I had a need for it, and I've found it quite useful. I released it in the hope that others
        will also find it useful.
