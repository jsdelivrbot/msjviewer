    <h1>Mobile MSJ</h1>

    <h2>The <em>Unofficial</em> Android MSJ app</h2>

    <p>
        This is an <em>unofficial</em> Android app to help you use MSJ from your Android phone.
        It is not affiliated with St John in any way, other than being created by a St John member.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a hobby project, and I take no responsibility if it doesn't work, kills a kitten, or catches fire.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        This app works like your web browser - it literally visits the official MSJ website and
        displays the contents to you in the app. However, before displaying them, the app changes
        the "styles" to make it fit better on a smaller mobile phone screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why the screen may flicker a little bit after displaying a page. It is first
        loading the original, and then it is restyling it to display nicely on a mobile device.
    </p>

    <a href="#tech-details" onclick="document.getElementById( 'tech-details' ).style.display='block';">(View technical details)</a>

    <div id="tech-details" style="display: none;">
        <a name="tech-details"></a>
        <p>
            The app uses an Android <code>WebView</code> to render the MSJ website. Once a page is loaded,
            a <code>javascript:</code> URL is loaded, which:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Creates one or more <code>link</code> DOM nodes.</li>
            <li>Sets the <code>href</code> attribute to a CSS file (hosted on GitHub, but proxied through https://cdn.rawgit.com).</li>
            <li>Attaches the <code>link</code> node to the <code>head</code> of the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This has the effect of applying the CSS in the linked file to the page being viewed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The app intentionally does <em>not</em>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Proxy traffic from MSJ.</li>
            <li>Modify (or even read) the HTML of the page once loaded.</li>
            <li>Manually save your username and password (the "remember password" feature is provided by the Android <code>WebView</code>, not by this app).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>

    <p>
        It was built because I was frustrated at the non-mobile-friendly MSJ website.
        Most times that the website is useful is at divisional meetings and at events, when
        you are around other volunteers and deciding together what events to attend.
        It is at these times that you most need a mobile friendly version of the website.
        I released the app it in the hope that others will also find it useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Find a bug? / Want to request a feature?</h2>

    <p>
        If you found a bug in this app, or there is a feature that you think is missing,
        contact me at peter.serwylo@gmail.com. Send through as much detail as possible,
        and I'll endeavour to get back to you.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        This app respects your privacy. It doesn't send information anywhere other
        than the official MSJ website (https://ssl.stjohnvic.com.au).
        If you are technically minded, and would like to verify this, the code is free and open source
        (https://github.com/pserwylo/msjviewer).
